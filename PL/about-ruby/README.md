1. Lack of multi threads.
   Concurrency is hard, especially in ruby. Many other languages like Rust, Elixir, Scala, Clojure make multi-core programming easy. These fancy things cannot exists in Ruby because of GIL. Go http://awesome-ruby.com/#awesome-ruby-concurrency, and you can see only three libraries there, and difficult to use.
2. Lack of basic type constraints. (One thing I like Elixir/Erlang most is  optional type definitions.) Type is the new sexy:
   - Many languages based on JVM are typed.
   - Many languages based on LLVM are typed.
   - Many languages based on BEAM are typed.
3. Too many magic boxes. Yeah, I mean meta-programming.
4. Pool docs. I hate it. Writing it is hard, Reading it is harder.
5. No new sexy projects. RoR is too big to fall, and it's going to fall.
6. The community is less active.
7. I will not criticize the performance, as Ruby is nothing to do with it.
8. To be continued.
